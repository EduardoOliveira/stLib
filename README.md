# stLib
A platform that allows the viewing and managment of 3d printing related projects and assets

# Help needed
This is a first release of somethig made over a summer vacation. There is much to improve and implement.
Join discord and lets talk.

## Problem
Many of us hoard a tone of STL's from public sites, pathreons and so forth. Keeping a tidy library easy to access and search proved dificult (at least for me).

## Approche
The main goal is to achive a self-hostable platform that work on top of the organization you already have, allowing you to have a nice overview of what you have collected so far.
